# Overview

As a software engineer student, I am committed to enhancing my skills and knowledge in programming by building practical applications. The Weather Forecast App demonstrates my ability to utilize Java for creating a functional application that retrieves real-time weather data from an online API and presents it in a user-friendly format.

The primary goal of this software is to provide users with current weather conditions and forecasts based on their input location, whether it's a city or a state. Through this project, I aimed to learn about API integration, data parsing, and how to handle user input effectively in Java.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- **IDE**: Eclipse for Java development
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Libraries**: I utilized the standard Java libraries for networking and data manipulation, and the `json-20210307.jar` library for JSON processing.

# Useful Websites

Here are some resources that were helpful throughout the development of this project:

- [OpenWeatherMap API Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [Java Networking Tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-networking)
- [Java Regular Expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/util/regex/index.html)

# Future Work

Looking ahead, I plan to enhance the Weather Forecast App by:

- Adding error handling for invalid user input and API response issues.
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive user experience.
- Expanding the application to provide 7-day forecasts and more detailed weather information.
- Incorporating a feature to save favorite locations for quick access to weather data.
