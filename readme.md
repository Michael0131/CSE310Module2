# Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to deepen my understanding of programming concepts and improve my skills in building applications. This project demonstrates my proficiency in the Java language by creating a software application that utilizes various Java features, such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and user interaction. 

The software I developed is an Expense Tracker, designed to help users manage their daily expenses and gain insights into their spending habits. By implementing features like data input, storage, and retrieval, I explored the intricacies of Java's syntax and libraries, enhancing my coding capabilities and understanding of software development.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Visual Studio Code with Java extensions for coding and debugging.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: I installed the latest version of OpenJDK to compile and run my Java programs.
- **Libraries**: I utilized the Java Collection Framework, specifically ArrayLists and HashMaps, to manage data efficiently within the application.

# Useful Websites

During this project, I found the following resources particularly helpful:

- [Java—Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
- [Java Tutorial—W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
- [Java Reference—Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)
- [Java Collection Frameworks—BeginnersBook](https://beginnersbook.com/java-collections-tutorial/)

# Future Work

There are several enhancements I plan to implement in future iterations of this software:

- **Data Persistence**: Implement file reading and writing functionalities to save and load user data.
- **User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the application more user-friendly.
- **Analytics Features**: Add functionalities to provide insights and visualizations based on user spending patterns.
